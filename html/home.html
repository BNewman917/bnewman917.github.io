            Hello! My name is Brent. I am a 32 year old Mechanical Engineering
            student from Ardmore, Oklahoma where I live with my wife, our
            daughter, two dogs and a cat. I have worked in the service industry
            in some capacity for most of my life. I have been a server,
            bartender, barista, manager, and for the past five years I have
            dealt table games, including at one of the largest casinos in the
            world. My goal is to switch to a more fulfilling career while being
            able to spend more time with my family.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy reading, yoga, building things, travelling, and playing
            video/tabletop games.

            that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit
            it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past, I will
            turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there
            will be nothing. Only I will remain.</span
